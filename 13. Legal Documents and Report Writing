# Common Documents

Sales Documents

Mutual Non-disclosure agrrements (NDA)
	Not allowed to talk about the findings I have discovered, and you can't discuss our methodology

Master Service Agreement (MSA)
	Contractual document outlines objectives and responsibilites for each party.

Statement of Work (SOW)
	Outlines activities, timelines, deliverables, payments
	
Others: 
	Sample Reports, Recommendation letters, etc.

PRE-Engagement

Rules of Engagement
	Defines exact IP range, excluded machines/IP's. unauthorized testing (DoS, Social Engineering), DO NOT START UNTIL THIS IS SIGNED

Post Engagement

Findings Report
	Describes what was found at a high-level, as well as technical details of how the test was conducted


# Common Findings

Insufficient Authentication Controls

MFA not implemented, logins can be bypassed with password sprays and scans
Use VPN or ensure MFA is enabled everywhere
Usually High-Critical
NIST 800-53 IA-2(11)

Weak Password Policy

Logging in with “winter2021” usually means they have a bad password
Policy Password is public and viewable
Try to sign up
use denylists that block dictionary words/rockyou/other breached lists
NIST 800-63B 

Insufficient Patching

Versions with open, known vulnerabilities and CVE's.
Legacy/Out of Date systems
Upgrade to latest patch/version
NIST 800-53 MA-6
NIST 800-53 SI-2

Default Credentials

Very fast compromise
VERY common (ALWAYS CHECK)
Change the manufacturer password immediately on opening
NIST 800-53 IA-5

Insufficient Encryption

MOST common
Not using HTTPS
Weak Ciphers (low for attack)
	SSL/TLS1 / Sweet32 / RC4 / Self Signed
Disable weak ciphers
NIST 800-53 IA-2(11)

Information Disclosure

System/Error/User information
mDNS disclose hostname/architecture
Server response headers reveal infrastructure
OWASP - Improper Error Handling

Username Enumeration

Login Portals may provide username enumeration
Forgot Password feature reveals valid email
Synchronize error messages ("check your email")


Default Web Pages

Unconfigured / Test pages left open
Shows weak security posture for the organization
Try to directory bust and find other misconfigurations
Remove unused web app or add terms or service/other info

IKE Aggressive Mode

Aggressive mode allows for capture of VPN Pre Shared Key and gain access ot network
Low likelihood but high impact
NIST 800-53 CM-7

Unexpected Perimeter Services

RDP. Telnet open from the internet
Note any services outward facing
Easily crackable

Insufficient Traffic Blocking

Is the site blocking traffic from random locations
https://shotsherpa.com
Limit attack surface and block odd traffic
NIST 800-53 CM-7

Undetected Malicious Activity

Did not detect scans, trojans,malware, etc used during testing
Review SIEM strategy and make inprovements
Low-informational
List attacks missed and detected

Historical Account Compromise

Users and Passwords found in Breaches
HIGH-Critical 
Review who is current employee, add passwords to deny list, users should not register for accounts with work email, avoid password reuse
NIST 800-53 MA-6
NIST 800-53 SI-2

# Client Debriefing

Review report in PDF or Powerpoint
Talk about findingd at 30,000ft
Common Issues
Tell story
Our job is to find bugs before the bad guys do
Occasionally may get pushback. Handle the adversity

# Attestation Letter

A Proof of services rendered (Copy / Paste of Executive Summary) 
Overall summary and conclusion
Client Retesting
	Going back to test remediations made from findings
	If it was fixed, Good job, but do not remove. Mark it as remediated
	Project is not done until you retest
