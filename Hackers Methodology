#Objectives of an External Pentest

Trying to test the security from an attackers perspective. 
Can a hacker access the system? 
What weaknesses are present in the system?
Provide potential remediation steps
PROTECT THE CLIENT

#External Checklist

Ensure ROE is signed by Client
Add IP's to Scope TAB
Verify scope with customer
Send Kick-off email
Conduct Vuln scan with Nessus
Identify leaked/breached credentials
Identify employees and email format
Identify websites and search for relevant data (job postings, system info, policy)
Enumerate any accounts on portals, password resets, etc
Run a web app scan (if applicable)
Manually test and exploit target
Validate vulnerabilities found in scanning
Conduct password spray & Bruteforcing on login portals
Escalate from internal to external
Validate previous test results (if applicable)
Cleanup

#Rules of Engagement

Signed document after MSA, Quote, etc are completed

Defines roles, responsibilities, and bounds of the test beging performed
Team members authorized to engage
Customer Point of Contact
Company Point of Contact
Rules:
Test Dates
Discolsure
Status Updates
Scope (IP's)
Potential disruptive testing
Bounds (exclusions)
Stop Point
Maintaining Access
Announcement
Project Closure
Post-Mortem
Out-Of-Scope
Disclaimer
Acceptance (MUST BE SIGNED BY REPRESENTATIVE)

#Verifying Scope

Screw this up and YOU GO TO JAIL. 
Ensure that the IP range/ Websites given to you belong to the client

#Use to verify scope

https://bgp.he.net/net
https://dnschecker.org/all-tools.php

#Communication

Low-Med findings may not need alot of communications
High-Critical should have immediate contact (RCE, Vulns)

#Kick-Off email
Notify of start, IP Range agreed upon, Attacker IP
Automate!! (email, Nessus scan can be automated to begin ASAP)


#Attack Strategy

RCE is unlikely (if it was available, an attacker would have already gotten to it)
Password strength. weak password policy is far more likely. No MFA
OSINT can definietly help you figure out what you are looking for
WebApp may not be interesting, but you CAN try to attack it.

#Vulerability Scanning

Begin with an Advanced Scan
set targets/range
Schedule it to begin immediately once engagement begins
Set ALL ports to scan (1-65535)
Ensure Web App are scanned (check other Assessments as well)
May take a while depending on size of scope

#Reviewing and Extracting Information

Alot of data will be low priority, don't waste time writing a 1000 page document, provide reports on vulnerabilities found using:

#Export Nessus File
Export PDF report (Executive, Custom with Everything)
Export HTML report

Melcara Nessus Parser (melcara.com)
Run and export it to XLSX
